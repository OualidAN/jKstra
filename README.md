jKstra - A simple graph and routing library
===========================================

**jKstra** is a JavaScript library to work with **graphs** - as in "data structures", with edges and vertices, not as in "graphics".

It is targeted at applications that need to manipulate graph structures and run algorithms on them. Typically path-finding like the Dijkstra algorithm, hence the name.

*It was made quickly to support a small project that needed to run offline shortest path computations on public transportation networks.
I had to code a specific layer to manipulate such networks easily, but it relied directly on the graph model and algorithms of jKstra. I may release that public transportation lib at some point in the future.*
